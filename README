If you'd like to compile the code, run it, and look at the data
the way we've done it, then just run "proj3.sh."  It's worked
for me before, and it will again.  If you do decide to use it
and it doesn't work , just email me at "patl1@vt.edu" and I'll 
fix it.

If you don't want to run the script, then you can compile 
everything like so:

mpicc -o part_a ring_matrix_part_a.c
mpicc -o part_b -fopenmp ring_martrix_part_b.c
mpicc -o part_c ring_matrix_part_c.c

The programs should run with the following:

mpirun -np <num_processors> -hostfile <your_hostfile> ./part_a <matrix size>
mpirun -np <num_processors> -hostfile <your_hostfile> ./part_b <matrix size> <num_threads>
mpirun -np <num_processors> -hostfile <your_hostfile> ./part_c <matrix size>

The field <matrix size> should be a number that is divisible by 
<num_processors>.  

Again, if you have any questions, please let me know 
(Pat Lewis, patl1@vt.edu) and I'll clear everything up.

Happy grading!
